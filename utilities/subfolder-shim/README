PROBLEM: you want to use Shibboleth to protect only PART of your URL space,
so that you can have non-authenticated interactions with users who
are not yet part of your community.

OBVIOUS SOLUTION: use a <Location /shibboleth> block. This totally works.

AUGH: you can't, for whatever reason. You need to use a <Directory> block instead. OK, here's how you can work around it by "shimming" the user back up into index.php.

HOW TO INSTALL: copy this folder to the subfolder of your web folder
that matches the path you are protecting directly with Shibboleth.
Then, in your web/.htaccess file, exempt that folder from the
usual mod_rewrite rules like so:

    # We skip the shibboleth shim script folder
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/shibboleth
    RewriteRule .* - [L]

Install these new rules AFTER these existing rules:

    # we skip all files with .something, except .html
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \..+$
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.html$
    RewriteRule .* - [L]

Then set the following in app.yml so that sfShibbolethPlugin will
know to redirect users who are ready to authenticate to the special
controller in the shibbolized folder (substitute the folder you
are directly shibbolizing if it's not /shibboleth):

prod:
  sfShibboleth:
    shim: "https://yoursite/shibboleth"

Finally, change the redirect URL in the shim folder's index.php
script to point wherever YOUR routing rules have put sfShibbolethAuth/login.
With Apostrophe it's typically /admin/sfShibbolethAuth/login. With
no special routing rules in effect it'll be /sfShibbolethAuth/login.
